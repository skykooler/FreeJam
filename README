FreeJam aims to provide an open-source alternative to GarageBand. It uses OpenGL
for drawing. There are currently three versions of the code: a Python version, 
an experimental raw C++ version, and a C++ version using OpenFrameworks (the
final version). There are a bunch of dependencies for the Python version which
are difficult to install; also, the C++ version should give better performance
when it is up to the same point. Sound does not work in the raw C++ version (and
probably never will), but is working in the OpenFrameworks version.


You need libasound-dev to install PyRTMidi on linux.
