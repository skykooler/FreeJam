FreeJam aims to provide an open-source alternative to GarageBand. It uses OpenGL
for drawing. There are currently two versions of the code: a Python version and 
a C++ version. This is because there are a bunch of dependencies for the Python 
version which are difficult to install; also, the C++ version should give better
performance when it it up to the same point (currently sound doesn't work yet).


You need libasound-dev to install PyRTMidi on linux.
